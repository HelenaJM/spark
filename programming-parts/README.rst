Parts of Programming
=============================

This writing is about understanding what programming is at the core, it's an exploration of parts involved in programming and how do they fit together. Hopefully these thoughts will give ideas how to learn and teach programming better.


	**DISCLAIMER:**

	I will write as directly as possible, therefore some things may seem as strong opinions although they are not. I find that having text such as “in my opinion”, “I think that”, “except in the case of magnetic storms” will make the text unreadable. Also, if you have been programming for a while and some points seem trivial, keep in mind that these points may not be trivial to a beginner. Some of these things are so internalized that we can't imagine other people not doing it. Also, treat all of the following information as opinions that can and may change.

This whole thing is written in 4 parts.

The first part "Basics of Programming" starts with introducing a model for understanding how different things (such as skill, knowledge, language) affect the programmer. Then it goes over a lot of things where beginners get stuck. At the same time it gives an overview of essential parts of programming, things that every programmer does without realizing it.

The second part "Better Programming" is a more thorough investigation on programming topics. It's about things that make some programmers better than others. It's about things that help you to learn to be a better programmer. It's about discussing things that programmers have to deal with every day.

The third part "Great Programming" is about ideas that can push programming to the next level.

The fourth part "Links for the Curious" is a collection of links to articles, books, videos, code, tutorials and other things related to programming. It has also some discussion why I have chosen them.

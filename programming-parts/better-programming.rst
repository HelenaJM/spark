Better programming
==================

The overview
------------

Well the easiest way to be a better programmer is to embrace this:

	"Everything sucks, your job is to know what sucks less"

	- Scott Carmichael

There are other ways of saying it ("Everything has flaws", "No Silver Bullet"), but I like that more since it gives direction to the things you do. If you need to understand something it's much more efficient to try to find flaws in it. You'll find the good points anyway. If you know the flaws you can make better decisions.

Even this essay has flaws in it, one of them being too general and not validating all the claims, but it hopefully has value nevertheless. Every programming language, framework, design pattern, architecture, rule and idea will have flaws in them - you just need to find them.



Simple, Complex, Easy, Hard
---------------------------

Instead of reading this part you should watch `Rich Hickeys "Simple Made Easy"`__. He gives a great overview and importance of these terms.

.. _SimpleMadeEasy: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/

__ SimpleMadeEasy_

Here we'll use these definitions:

* simple - means not compound - not composed of two or more parts
* complex - means braided or tangled - composed of two or more parts
* easy - means not to require great labor or effort
* hard - means requiring great effort

So making things simpler means untangling things. Making things easy means lowering the friction. Simple, complex are objective and easy, hard are subjective.

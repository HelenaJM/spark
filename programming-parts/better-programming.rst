Better programming
==================

The overview

	"Everything sucks, your job is to know what sucks less"

"If you don't understand the downsides of an approach, then you don't understand it."
"Everything sucks, the key to success is knowing what sucks less." - ScottCarmichael
"Everything sucks... your job is to know what sucks less."


Managing complexity

Making things ...
-----------------

Useful
~~~~~~

	"Good abstractions are simple."
	"Simple things are simple if they require no instruction"
	Bret Victor

Reliable
~~~~~~~~

	try catch
	err
	assertions
	contracts
	functional

	Writing good tests
	Asserting

Fast
~~~~

	"Measure before optimization."

Simple
~~~~~~

	"Balancing code and model."
	"Making things simple is hard work!"
	Rich Hickey
	Limits

	"Make simple things simple, complex things doable and visible."
	(avoid making complex things simple, because they are not simple)

	Complect, Compose = make visible complecting

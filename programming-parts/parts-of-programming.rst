Parts of Programming
=============================

This writing is about understanding what programming is at the core, it's an exploration of parts involved in programming and how do they fit together. Hopefully these thoughts will give ideas how to learn and teach programming better.


	**DISCLAIMER:**

	I will write as directly as possible, therefore some things may seem as strong opinions although they are not. I find that having text such as “in my opinion”, “I think that”, “except in the case of magnetic storms” will make the text unreadable. Also, if you have been programming for a while and some points seem trivial, keep in mind that these points may not be trivial to a beginner. Some of these things are so internalized that we can't imagine other people not doing it. Also, treat all of the following information as opinions that can and may change.
